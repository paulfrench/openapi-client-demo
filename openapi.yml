  title: Wrapper of Twilio API
  description: |
    Wrapper of Twilio API so we can send adhoc sms etc. To use you need to make sure an applicationCode
    has been setup in the SMS service so the correct Twilio Account and Auth Code can be looked up and
    used by the SMS service. Each Twilio account is setup to send SMS either globally or to the countries
    of choice.

        The payload holds the mobile number which needs to be in E.164 format, the SMS text itself and
        the applicationCode so if required the cost of sending the SMS can be assigned to the correct market
      required:
       - mobileNumber
       - applicationCode
       - text
      properties:
        mobileNumber:
          type: string
          description: |
            Has to be in E.164 standard format e.g. a UK mobile number +447803122059
        applicationCode:
          type: string
          description: |
            Using the application code we lookup the Twilio Account and Twilio Auth Token as well as any
            other information needed to send the SMS e.g. we may need a global Twilio from number

            The input string should be UTF-8 encoded. If the UTF-8 chars are only ASCII chars then GSM-7 is used
            but if you use any non-ASCII characters then UCS-2 encoding is automatically used by Twilio. 
            Additonally, Twilio prepends a User Data Header of 6 Bytes (this instructs
            the receiving device on how to assemble messages), leaving 153 GSM-7 characters or
            67 UCS-2 characters for your message. Hence why it is important to shorten URL's etc for UCS-2
            messages, we only have 67 characters to use before the message is split into multiple messages
            which will not be desirable
